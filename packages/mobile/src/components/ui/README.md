# Gluestack components

You should not modify the functionality any of the components in this directory.
They are generated by the Gluestack CLI and are intended to be used as-is.

The only changes that have been made to them are corrections to the TypeScript
definitions, which are necessary to make them compile with our strict TypeScript
settings.

Instead, create a new component that uses the Gluestack component as a base and
modify that component as needed.
